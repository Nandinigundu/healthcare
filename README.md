Healthcare Appointment Booking App
A simple and responsive React app where users can browse doctors, check their availability, and book appointments easily.

Live Demo
https://healthcareappbooking.netlify.app/

-> What I Used
React.js – For building the user interface

React Router DOM – To enable navigation between pages

JavaScript (ES6+) – The programming language I used

CSS3 – For styling the app, with separate styles for each component

Create React App – To quickly set up the project

Netlify – Where I deployed the app


-> What This Project Does
Shows a list of doctors with search by name or specialization

Lets you see detailed info on each doctor’s profile page

Allows booking an appointment with patient name, email, and date/time

Confirms your booking once you submit the form

Uses component-level CSS so each part of the app has its own styles


-> Challenges and How I Fixed Them
Keeping data consistent without a real backend:
I used React's state and URL params and stored doctors info in static JSON files to simulate data flow.

Setting up navigation and organizing components:
React Router helped with navigation, and putting each component in its own folder with separate CSS made everything neat and manageable.

Styling without Tailwind CSS:
Instead of Tailwind, I wrote simple CSS files per component to keep styles isolated and easy to work on.
